# Login System Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Firebase App ID
- **Problem**: The `.env.local` file was missing the `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID` which is required for Firebase to work properly.
- **Fix**: Added the correct Firebase App ID to the environment configuration.

### 2. Type Mismatch in User Interface
- **Problem**: The `UserProfile` interface didn't match the expected `User` interface with proper `userType` typing.
- **Fix**: Updated the interface to match exactly:
  ```typescript
  export interface UserProfile {
    uid: string;
    name: string;
    email: string;
    contactDetails: string;
    description: string;
    githubUrl: string;
    linkedinUrl: string;
    profileImageURL: string;
    role: "user" | "organizer" | string;
    userType: "user" | "host" | string;
    techStack?: string | string[] | null;
    updatedAt?: any;
    isApproved?: boolean;
  }
  ```

### 3. Complex Login State Management
- **Problem**: The login page had overly complex state management that could cause authentication issues.
- **Fix**: Simplified the login logic and improved error handling.

### 4. Missing Registration Page
- **Problem**: Users couldn't create accounts because the registration page didn't exist.
- **Fix**: Created a complete registration page at `/register` that:
  - Creates Firebase auth users
  - Creates user profiles in Firestore
  - Sets proper `userType` and `role` fields
  - Handles both "user" and "host" account types

## How the Login System Now Works

### 1. User Registration
1. User goes to `/register`
2. Fills out the form with their details
3. Selects account type: "user" or "host"
4. System creates Firebase auth account
5. System creates Firestore user profile with:
   - `userType`: "user" or "host"
   - `role`: "user" or "organizer" (auto-assigned based on userType)

### 2. User Login
1. User enters email/password on `/login`
2. Firebase authenticates the user
3. System fetches user profile from Firestore using the UID
4. System checks the `userType` field:
   - If `userType === "user"`: User is automatically logged in as a user and redirected to home
   - If `userType === "host"`: User sees role selector to choose between "user" or "organizer"
5. Based on selected role, user is redirected:
   - User role → Home page (`/`)
   - Organizer role → Organizer dashboard (`/organizer/events`)

### 3. Role-Based Access Control
- **Users** (`userType: "user"`): Can only access user features, register for events
- **Hosts** (`userType: "host"`): Can access both user and organizer features
- **Organizers** (`role: "organizer"`): Can create and manage events

## Testing the Login System

### 1. Test User Registration
1. Go to `/register`
2. Fill out the form with test data
3. Select "User" as account type
4. Submit the form
5. Verify user is created in Firebase Auth and Firestore

### 2. Test User Login
1. Go to `/login`
2. Enter the credentials from step 1
3. Verify user is automatically logged in and redirected to home page
4. Check browser console for authentication logs

### 3. Test Host Registration and Login
1. Go to `/register`
2. Fill out the form with test data
3. Select "Host" as account type
4. Submit the form
5. Go to `/login` and sign in
6. Verify role selector appears
7. Test both "Login as User" and "Login as Organizer" options

### 4. Check Database
1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore
2. Check the `users` collection
3. Verify user documents have:
   - `userType` field set correctly
   - `role` field set correctly
   - All required fields populated

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure your `.env.local` file contains:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

## Firebase Configuration Required

1. **Authentication**: Enable Email/Password provider
2. **Firestore**: Create `users` collection with proper security rules
3. **Security Rules**: Ensure users can read/write their own profiles

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **"Firebase: Error (auth/app-not-initialized)"**: Check Firebase App ID in environment
2. **"User profile not found"**: Verify user document exists in Firestore `users` collection
3. **"userType is missing"**: Check that user documents have the `userType` field
4. **Login not redirecting**: Check browser console for authentication state logs

### Debug Steps:
1. Check browser console for authentication logs
2. Verify Firebase configuration in browser
3. Check Firestore database for user documents
4. Verify environment variables are loaded correctly

## Next Steps

1. Test the registration and login flow
2. Create test users with different userTypes
3. Verify role-based routing works correctly
4. Test event registration and creation flows
5. Remove debug components once everything works
